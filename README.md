# How to Install Bookmarks Dook
The Plugin Manager with Notepad++ is not pulling in the latest version of Bookmarks Dook.  Instead you should monitor this GitHub for updated releases.

## Link to Current Release
https://github.com/Dook1/Bookmarks-Dook/releases/latest

Download the appropriate ZIP folder based on your version of Notepad++ 32 vs 64.

## Where Do I Place DLL from Current Release to Install
1. Open Notepad++ and navigate to **Plugins>Open Plugins Folder**
2. In the window that opens create a Folder named **BookmarksDook**.  It is important it is named this exactly as the name of DLL must match the folder.
3. Paste the DLL file that was downloaded from the release into this folder
